# Thermo-mechanical codes
GEO4-1442_UU_Thermo-chemical_codes_2020_period1
The codes were created for the course GEO4 - 1402 - Modelling of the Lithosphere and Crust Deformation offered by Utrecht University,
2020 period 1, and coordinated by Dr. Y. van Dinther.
These were coded on MATLAB.
- Aegean_extension_acceleration codes a two-phase extension as described by Brun et al. (2016) using a wet-quartzite crust and a granitic intrusion
  as suggested in Tirel et al. (2008). The first phase lasts for 20 Myr and the second one for 10 Myr.
- Mechanical_code_1D codes 1D flow patterns that can be applied to dikes or subduction channels for example which is the case for Subduction_channel.
- Thermal_code_1D codes 1D temperature evolution of a temperature anomaly. Here, it is applied to a magmatic intrusion between 10 and 11 km depth.
